# Additional Plots

## Figure 5
The figures below describe how the total number of
variants generated changes by querying the LLM repeatedly
with the same prompt. 
The x-axis shows the number of prompts, and 
the y-axis shows the percentage of variants generated.

The figure seen below is the one present in the paper. 
It shows the average behaviour across all chosen temperatures.

The figures below are **supplementary**, they depict the
behaviour for each of the chosen temperature values.

![Temperature 0.9](/images/fig5/temp_0.9.png)

![Temperature 1.2](/images/fig5/temp_1.2.png)



## Figure 7

The figures below describe how the number of
hallucinations increases with the increase in number of 
fix-point iterations. 

The figure seen below is the one present in the paper. 
It shows the behavior for temperature 0.

The figures below are **supplementary**, they depict the
behaviour for the remaining chosen temperature values.
